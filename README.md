# Yue Discord Bot

**Yue** is a spanish-speaking Discord bot designed to maintain a single conversation shared among all users, with a shared long-term memory. It leverages the [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) library for bot interactions and [OpenAI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/openai) (DeepSeek endpoint) for generating text responses.

---

## Features

1. **Shared Conversation**: All messages go into a single, global history.
2. **Shared Memory**: A single `long_term_memory.json` file stores overall knowledge, summaries, and facts.
3. **Mention/Keyword Trigger**: Yue responds if mentioned with `@Yue` or if certain keywords (like `"yue"`) appear in the message.
4. **Cooldown**: A short cooldown (8 seconds by default) to prevent spam or overload.
5. **Condensed Summaries**: Periodically summarizes the last N messages to keep the conversation context smaller.
